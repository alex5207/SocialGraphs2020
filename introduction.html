    This website is a network analysis of the biggest 500 Hollywood actors based on data from 5000 movies
    created between 1916 and 2017.
    <p style="margin-top:5px;font-size:18px">
      <b> Network </b> <br />
      We analyze the network to understand how actors are connected, how
      genres develop and productivity of actors. For other interesting aspects
      such as <text id="comDet">community detection</text>, see

      <b > A sign of the times </b> <br />
      Furthermore, we pose the question of whether Hollywood movie descriptions
      say something about the time of which they were created. We compare with
      the Wikipedia pages from different decades.
