<p class="h3"> Sentiment through the decades </p>

      Sentiment analysis (see below) on the movie descriptions and wikipedia pages
      reveals a very steady curve over time (<em>notice the scale</em>). <br />
      <br />
      Even though the sentiment diverts in the 2010s, the average sentiment of
      the movie descriptions and wikipedia pages are so close that we cannot tell
      if there is a difference. <br />

      The right plot below shows the most positive and negative words used on the Wikipedia
      pages of each decade. Notice that most of the words are present in all decades.
      <strong> It seems like most of the words are needed to describe every decade </strong>

      <h4 class="alert-heading"> What is sentiment analysis? <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span></h4>
      <p>
        Sentiment analysis is a technique to analyse the sentiment of a piece of text
        by analysing the hapiness of the words and tokens that comprise the text.

    The average sentiment of movie descriptions and wikipedia pages does not
    reveal any changes in sentiment over time. Maybe the good is averaged out
    by the bad? After all, a whole lot happens in a decade and it can't be
    <em>all that bad</em>
