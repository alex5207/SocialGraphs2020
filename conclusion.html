  <h2 class="display-4">Conclusions</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    This project has revealed some interesting facts about the network
    of Hollywood actors and actresses. Wee saw that the average actor
    has worked with 65 other actors and some (e.g Bruce Willis) have
    worked with more than 150 out of the 500 actors - Indeed a small world... <br />

    We also saw how the <u> genres have developed over time</u>,
    with Drama being
    the uncrowned Queen of Hollywood at all times. <br /> <br />
    <strong> On text analysis</strong> <br />
    Lastly, we attempted to analyse the movie description of Hollywood.
    It is clearly difficult to convey meaning to the words, but we can conclude
    that the type of language in movie descriptions is vastly different from
    descriptions in Wikipedia pages.

  <p style="font-size:16px;">
    For future work, we recommend refining the language processing of the movie
    descriptions and reconsider whether to use Wikipedia pages as the
    <em> sole truth</em>. We genuinely believe that Hollywood is a product
    of the world we live in - Help us show it!
